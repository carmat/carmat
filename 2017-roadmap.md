# 2017 Roadmap

Rather than make resolutions that I won't stick to, I've come to the realisation that I should at least create a roadmap for the things I want to create, learn, and build.

For a front-end developer, the world moves at an incredibly fast pace. It feels as if there's always something new-to-market every week that would be foolish to avoid.

There are also things happening with the core web that I'm yet to properly get my hands dirty with. Things like the range HTML5 APIs, Web Components, and the ever-expanding world of JavaScript e.g. Angular, React, Redux...

With all of this in mind, there are a couple of other things I'd like to have in my repertoire, mainly in the server-side area. My day-do-day job requires a higher level of PHP than I'm normally subject to, so that needs to progress. However, something I've been keen on picking up is Python, and see where that takes me.

## So what's the plan..?

1. **Progress / Personal Website**

    Set up a new personal website. This will be the focal point for documenting my progress throughout the year.

2. **UI Library**

    I've already made a stuttering start on a customisable UI library, but it hasn't got much further than a refactored CSS grid.

3. **Web Application Playground**

    Plan, design, create, and develop a web application for a small business close to my heart with the aim of using it as a playground for multiple disciplines of web development, from APIs and Database Schema planning on the back-end, to a wealth of front-end technologies as a means of learning and advancing my skills, eventually towards using it as a means of advertising my worth.

4. **Raspberry Pi / IoT**

    Santa got me a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B for Christmas, and there's a Pi Zero on the way as well. I've got a couple of projects in mind, so watch this space...
